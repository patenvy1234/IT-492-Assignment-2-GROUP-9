## Comparison between Model and Memory based approach

1.Memory based approaches have given recommendations that are similar to those that similar user have interacted in the past. On the other hand the Model based approach has given much more diverse results by finding the latent factors in the system.

2.Memory based approach has given almost instant results when used to give predictions for certain user whereaes the Model based approach are much slower, time consuming and computationaly expensive as it has to train on the data to find those latent factors
